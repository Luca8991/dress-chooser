# dress-choser
The program that, when starter, chooses random dresses from my wardrobe

# how it works
The program uses PHP to retrieve from a MySQL DB random t-shirts, trousers and sweatshirts. When the webpage is called, PHP writes the combination of random dresses.
It is done with an SQL JOIN statement, which combines right trousers with right t-shirts and sweatshirts (yellow trousers don't match with blue sweatshirts!)
